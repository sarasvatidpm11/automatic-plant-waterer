# Automatic Plant Waterer integrated with Solar Panels for power
Hi everyoneüëãüèª. This is my final project in the Renewable Energy Systems cross-study course in the Electronic Systems Engineering Technology study program. In this project I used two sensors, namely a water level sensor and a soil moisture sensor. I use a 12V pump to pump water in the reservoir and use a relay for automatic switch. Power to run the system is supplied from Solar Panels which utilize solar energy which is processed and stored in the battery.

Here are some documentation images from my project
